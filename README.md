# Welcome to the HK docs


## Introduction

  <p>Here you will be able to find lots and lots of info regarding how to create your own HK documentation.</p>
  <p>This project was developed from creativity ground up and is meant to be forked/copied on the Replit service and edited on your own from there. This is not a web page template with everything but this template is a starter guide in order to create your HK styled documentation. Just as a note, this template may seem a little messy, but in order to make sure everything is working correctly, this is the way we decided to keep the format. It is very important that you guys follow this template because all of the information and all the files that are here, work accordingly, so it is important that you don't touch anything other than what we say is ok in this tutorial. Please note that many of the html files have gone editing changes but the main real content should come from you guys as thats why you want to create a documentation! The best way to do your documentation correctly is by not touching any of the files not mentioned and editing the files that were mentioned and asked to be edited.</p>



  <p>So what are you waiting for? Lets get started!</p>

## Editing index.html

### Tab Title

  <p>In this section of your index.html journey, we will start by changing the title of the tab. An example of a tab title is shown down below.</p>

<p>The "title" on the tab pictured below is named "The HK docs".</p>

<p>Pretty cool huh! Now, lets go ahead and have you change your title.</p>

#### Creating your title:
  <p>For starters, lets start by clicking on the "index.html" file in your list of files. Then find the "title" attribute at the top. Next delete the text that says "replit" and then type in what you want your website tab to say for example, we would have put the tab title as "The HK docs" </p>
  <p>The image is listed below for what you should modify. </p>

### Tab icon (favicon)

<p>In this section of Editing index.html, you will be able to find out how to change the tab icon, widely known as the "favicon".</p>

Here is an example of a favicon:

<img src="Readme/PicturesForReadme/faviconexample.png">

#### Changing the favicon

In order to change the favicon, you will preferrably need a square/circle looking png picture in order to sink in with the pre-written code. Once you have your image, make sure it is installed to your computer and upload the .png file to your programming workplace, if you are on replit, you would upload it to the replit file manager of this replit on the left, where it says "files". Once you go to your file manager of all the files in this template, open the "Pictures" folder and delete the file that says "favicon.png". Next, for any workplace, take your preffered .png favicon image and drop it into the "Pictures" folder of this template. After that rename your preffered favicon .png file to favicon.png. Refresh the tab and there you go, you can see your favicon image!
